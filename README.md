# Customer Churn Prediction at Orange
EDA &amp; prediction of customer churn at Orange with the use of Machine Learning. This project was done for practice in March 2020 using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The repository includes:
* [colab_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/colab_prediction.ipynb) – Python notebook file extracted from Google Colab
* data
  * [orange_score.csv](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/data/orange_score.csv) – dataset of 10k rows to make the ML model
  * [orange_train.csv](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/data/orange_train.csv) – dataset of 100k rows to do the churn prediction
 * results
  * [list_of_all_customers_likely_to_churn.csv](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/results/list_of_all_customers_likely_to_churn.csv) – list of all the 100k customers with the `probability_of_churn` score
  * [list_of_the_100_customers_most_likely_to_churn.xlsx](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/results/list_of_the_100_customers_most_likely_to_churn.xlsx) – the same list but limited to 100 rows in a descending order
  * [pandas_profiling_report.html](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/results/pandas_profiling_report.html) – Pandas Profiling report (as a quick/automated EDA)
  * [presentation_to_the_business.pdf](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/results/presentation_to_the_business.pdf) – 5-slide presentation about the findings for the Orange CEO
  * [technical_report.pdf](https://github.com/pyxelr/Customer_Churn_Prediction_at_Orange/blob/main/results/technical_report.pdf) – 31-page technical report explaining the dataset, implemented approach, experimental setup, results and providing the final conclusions.
